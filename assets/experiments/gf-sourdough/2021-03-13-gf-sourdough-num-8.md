## Instructions

This boule was proofed for about three hours in a 8 inch banneton, baked at 425ยบ for 45 minutes in a covered dutch oven, then cover removed and baked for an additional 20 minutes.

## Notes

In this attempt, I forgot to include salt, and the bread was very noticeably bland. Texture was slightly gummy.
