---

## Ingredients

- 150g sourdough starter (125% hydration - sorghum, quinoa, white rice flours)
- 100g water
- 80g brown rice flour
- (plus add 10g olive oil when mixing in liquids and yeast)

### Liquids
- 20g psyllium husk (whole, not powder)
- 15g maple syrup or honey
- 250g water

### Yeast
- 10g maple syrup or honey
- 50g water (120º F)
- 1/2 Tbsp instant/quick rise yeast

### Dry
- 70g tapioca starch/flour (**not** cassava flour)
- 90g potato starch (**not** potato flour)
- 40g millet flour
- 40g teff flour
- 40g sorghum flour

## Instructions

This was proofed for about ten hours in a bread pan, baked at 425º for 40 minutes covered in foil, then foil removed and baked for an additional 20 minutes.

## Notes

This was a good sandwich loaf with little rise. Bread was slightly tacky but the crust was softer with the olive oil.
