My name is Ray Tetzloff, and I'm here to learn. I don't really care if anyone else ever reads this. It's intended for me to help myself learn to be a better programmer, engineer, and whatever else I post about.

### random things

1. I'm an IT Generalist. I've worked in IT for most of the last 15 years. I've worked as a data center engineer, a network engineer, a systems administrator, and I do some programming.  
1. I love physics and science in general. My college degree is actually in Chemistry. Coupled with my IT background, I'm intrigued by wireless communications, and in particular, Wi-Fi.
1. I am very introverted. I don't like parties. I don't like crowds. They exhaust me, and it takes a long time to recover from such gatherings.
1. I love to cook, but I've got Celiac Disease and probably some other intolerances or allergies. I love to try different methods of gluten free baking and cooking.

### goals

My goals at starting a blog are primarily to enhance my learning, and to give back to the communities I enjoy. Maybe it helps to become a better writer. Maybe it helps me actually learn. Maybe it helps to share a creation that I'm proud of. Maybe it's to document something I struggled with. This is mostly for me. I appreciate feedback, but I don't appreciate snide commentary and negative criticism. Please don't contribute if that's what you're going to contribute.
