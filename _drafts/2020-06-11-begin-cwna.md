So, this is my first real post on this platform. It's been a long time since I've written any sort of blog post type material. Even then, I've probably not written anything particularly substantive. Lol.

I am starting my CWNA journey today. Or, I suppose I started it a while ago, but I've set a deadline for taking the exam (July 6th). I'm hoping blogging will assist in the studying process. So, I suppose, take anything I say lightly, lol. My goal is not necessarily to teach anyone but myself. If others happen to be able to use it, great! If not, this is really intended for myself. I do have discussion enabled, and people are welcome to post civil conversation through it. I will do my best to answer in a timely fashion.

I've been interested in wireless for a long time. I've mostly been a network/systems engineer throughout much of my IT career, without any real specialization. I've worked with routers and switches of various brands. I've worked with Linux a lot, and Windows Server a little. I've done some programming in Python, and I've done some light network automation via scripting. I work with wireless frequently in my job. Or I suppose I *did* work with wireless frequently. Now, I mostly work with people who work with wireless. I take a lot of support escalations from technicians troubleshooting wireless issues. As such, my goals with becoming a CWNA are:

- Increase my knowledge in the wireless realm.
- Be able to speak more authoritatively to the technicians I deal with on a daily basis.
- Be able to train those same technicians and teach them to be more self-sufficient in their troubleshooting processes.
- Improve customer experience by helping to guide the wireless policies and procedures we use and better teaching technicians how to place, validate, and troubleshoot Wi-Fi.
- Reduce the number of escalations I get for Wi-Fi issues and reduce the number of interruptions to my longer-term projects I'm working on.
- Just plain to learn.

The other thing I should mention regarding the wireless services my company provides... I work for a small, independent Internet service provider, a more than century-old telephone company. Most of the wireless services we provide are residential, in-home Wi-Fi. I think there's been a general lack of experience and thought put into residential Wi-Fi. There's been a lot of misinformation about how best to place routers and access points throughout the house. I want to help my employer get away from the negative reputation that most ISPs have for the Wi-Fi equipment and placement. I want to help us give the best experience to our customers. It doesn't matter that they're residential customers. They don't need the huge roaming environments of large businesses, but with the growing trend of people working from home, a lot of customers aren't really just residential any more. Understanding how Wi-Fi works will help myself, but it'll also help our staff and technicians. It'll also help our customer have a better experience.

And so, after reading through the [unofficial CWNA Study Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Wireless-Network-Administrator-Study/dp/1119425786/) once already (and referencing it *many* more times), I plan to use this blog as a way to help myself learn. I don't know how frequently I'll be able to post. It's possible that it ends up being a post a week or less frequently. Maybe I'll give up (though I don't intend to). Maybe there will be multiple posts some days. I may end up pushing my exam back, depending on how much time and effort I put into this. Regardless, I hope to use this as a way to help myself learn.
