trial: "02"
---

## Ingredients

### Preferment (prepare at night and proof until morning)
- 150g sourdough starter (125% hydration - sorghum, quinoa, white rice flours)
- 100g water
- 80g brown rice flour
- (plus add 10g olive oil when mixing in liquids and yeast)

### Liquids
- 20g psyllium husk (whole, not powder)
- 20g maple syrup or honey
- 300g water

### Dry
- 60g tapioca starch/flour (**not** cassava flour)
- 80g potato starch (**not** potato flour)
- 80g sorghum flour
- 65g brown rice flour
- 12g fine sea salt

## Instructions

This boule was proofed for about three hours in a 8 inch banneton, baked at 425ยบ for 45 minutes in a covered dutch oven, then cover removed and baked for an additional 20 minutes.

## Notes

This was the second loaf made, and did not rise significantly. It mimicked the recipe from [Bakerita](https://www.bakerita.com/gluten-free-sourdough-bread/), but seemed too soft and spread too much while baking. It was very flat.
