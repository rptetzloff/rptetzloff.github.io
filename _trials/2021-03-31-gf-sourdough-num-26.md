- 100g water

- 35g sorghum flour
- 35g millet flour
- 40g teff flour
- 35g almond flour (gluten-free, of course)
- 12g fine sea salt

## Allergens

- This is/can be rice-free (the current starter has a little bit of rice in it, but that's an easy fix)

## Instructions

This was divided into eight portions for hamburger buns, placed into a hamburger mold pan, brushed with water, and
proofed for about ten hours in a hamburger bun mold, baked at 400ยบ for 30 minutes covered in foil, then foil removed and
baked for an additional 12 minutes.

## Notes

These buns were soft with a crust that was easy to chew. It held up well to a bacon, egg, and avocado breakfast sandwich.
