## Instructions

This was divided into eight portions for hamburger buns. They were proofed for about ten hours in a hamburger bun mold, baked at 425ยบ for 30 minutes covered in foil, then foil removed and baked for an additional 10 minutes.

## Notes

This was a good bun with softer crust due to olive oil. Nice chew and made a good breakfast sandwich that held together well.
