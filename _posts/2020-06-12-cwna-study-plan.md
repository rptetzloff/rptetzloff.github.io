title: CWNA Study Plan
---
As I work toward completing my [CWNA](https://www.cwnp.com/certifications/cwna) certification, I want to establish a study framework that I think makes sense for studying this. I'm sure there are a lot of different ways in which this can be studied, but in working with the [official study guide](https://www.amazon.com/CWNA-107-Certified-Wireless-Network-Administrator/dp/1976925045/), the [unofficial study guide](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Wireless-Network-Administrator-Study/dp/1119425786/), and the [exam objectives](https://www.cwnp.com/uploads/cwna-107-objectives-2017.pdf), there's a lot of material from which to learn. I think having a study plan that includes some prerequisites and works toward fulfilling the exam objectives will be beneficial.

    1. WPA
    1. WPA2
    1. WPA2 Enterprise
    1. Captive Portals and Guest Networks
    1. Secure Management
1. Design Requirements and Validation
    1. Site Survey

This probably looks a lot like a simpler version of the Exam Objectives, which makes a lot of sense, as that's what I'm looking to accomplish, lol. I do plan on having separate articles for the majority of these items, going into as much detail as I think is necessary to fulfill my studying needs.

I'm probably going to assume some level of understanding of these things. It's meant to help myself learn, but I also want to actually learn the topics, so I'm going to try to go into lower level details that I assume I know already. 

It's also very likely that I will be returning to older articles and adding, removing, or changing content. I will try to indicate this in some way, though I'm not yet sure how I will do so. It'll probably involve comments. It's very likely that I'll need to change the outline as we go along.
