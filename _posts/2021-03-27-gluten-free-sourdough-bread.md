# Gluten Free Sourdough Bread and Buns
This is the mixture I've settled on for making gluten free sourdough bread and buns.

## Ingredients

### Preferment (prepare at night and proof until morning)
- 150g sourdough starter (125% hydration - sorghum, quinoa, white rice flours)
- 100g water
- 80g brown rice flour
- (plus add 20g olive oil when mixing in liquids and yeast) [Optional, but highly recommended to soften the crust]

### Liquids
- 20g psyllium husk (whole, not powder)
- 15g maple syrup or honey
- 250g water

### Yeast
- 10g maple syrup or honey
- 50g water (120ยบ F)
- 1 Tbsp instant/quick rise yeast

### Dry
- 70g tapioca starch
- 90g potato starch
- 40g sorghum flour
- 40g millet flour
- 40g teff flour
- 35g oat flour
- 12g fine sea salt

## Directions
1. In the evening, I mix together the preferment in a glass bowl and a feed my starter. The preferment sits at room temperature, covered with a towel, until morning.
1. In the morning, I first mix the yeast, water, and maple syrup in a small glass bowl to activate the yeast. 
1. While the yeast is activating, I mix together the liquids in a glass bowl and then whisk the dry ingredients together in the bowl of a stand mixer. 
1. Mix yeast and liquids into preferment with olive oil and whisk until incorporated
1. With a spatula or wooden spoon stir the wet ingredients into dry until all of the dry ingredients are incorporated into the dough ball.
1. Use the dough hook of the stand mixer and mix on low for about five minutes, stopping a couple times to make sure all the dry is mixed in.
1. The next step depends on what you're making:
    - When making a **boule**, transfer dough to a floured (I use white rice flour) [8 inch banneton](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0888DWR7Y/).
    - When making a **sandwich loaf**, transfer dough to a floured (I use white rice flour) [bread pan with collar](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0130O7SP2/). Make sure the loaf is pushed down into the corners and roughly flat. Brush the loaf liberally with water.
    - When making **hamburger buns**, divide the dough into 8 equal portions (they should be about 120-125g each), and with liberally oiled hands, roll the dough portions into balls. Place the dough balls into a lightly floured (I use white rice flour) well of a [hamburger bun mold](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XQWJ5RP/) sitting on a [jelly roll pan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YKGROG/) or baking sheet, and lightly flatten. Brush liberally with water.
1. Regardless of what you're making, cover the dough with a light towel, and let rest all day at room temperature (8-10 hours should be fine).
1. When ready to bake the bread, preheat the oven to 425ยบ F. I use the convection fan in my oven. 
    - If baking a **boule** in a dutch oven, place dutch oven in oven while preheating.
1. Bake the bread, depending on what you're making:
    - For **boules**, make a parchment sling, and carefully transfer the loaf to the parchment. Score the loaf as desired with a sharp paring knife or bread lame. Remove the dutch oven from the oven and remove the lid. Carefully move the loaf to the dutch oven using the parchment sling. Cover the dutch oven and place back in oven. Bake for 45 minutes covered, then remove the lid, and bake for another 15 minutes.
    - For **sandwich bread**, again brush the loaf with water, and cover the loaf pan and collar with aluminum foil. Carefully put pan in oven, and bake for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 10 minutes.
    - For **hamburger buns**, again brush the rolls with water, and carefully and loosely cover the pan with foil. I use ring molds to space the foil above the rolls. Bake for 25 minutes, then remove foil and bake for another 10 minutes.
1. Remove bread from oven and carefully transfer to a cooling rack.
1. Let rest until completely cool. 

## Notes
I usually finish preparation and cover around 7am, preheat oven at 4:45pm, and then begin baking at 5:30ish, depending on when I get home from work. I let the bread rest until morning before cutting into to eat.

## Storage
I often slice sandwich loaves and boules and freeze. Hamburger buns get individually wrapped in plastic wrap and then stored in the freezer until ready to use.

## Consumption
This bread is great on its own, toasted with almond butter and fruit preserves, or griddled with olive oil, garlic, and salt. It makes great bread pudding and french toast. It's dense compared to gluten-y white bread, but it's on par (I think) to a very hearty Ezekiel bread sort of loaf. The buns hold up to loaded hamburgers and serve well in sausage and egg breakfast sandwiches.

Overall, this is one of the best gluten free breads I've tried!
